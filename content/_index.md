[The Nestery](https://thenestery.in/) is a curated parenting platform that helps parents discover maternity & childrenâ€™s products by adding much-needed context to the shopping experience. We do this by bringing the right selection, with the right information, at the right time during their parenting journey. 

Founded in 2019, we are one of the fastest-growing platforms in the parent-child space in India. We are home to over 450 brands and have the most wonderful community of over 100,000 parents being our cheerleaders in every way.

We are supported in this endeavour through amazing partnerships with Blume Leadtribe program, First cheque, Tremis Capital, and Rebalance and many more angel investors in the B2C space. We have been recently selected by Sequoia in their Spark Fellowship first cohort. The origin story, vision and a high level roadmap of where we want to go from here is covered in this [YourStory interview](https://yourstory.com/herstory/2021/12/women-entrepreneurs-curated-maternity-children-products-sequoia-spark/amp).
