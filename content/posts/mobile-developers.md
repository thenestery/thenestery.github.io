Ultimately, you would be responsible for design and development of the next generation of Social Commerce Mobile App(s) across platforms.

This is a core member position who will have a lot of opportunities to grow and be part of decisions that influence the engineering culture within the organisation. We also provide handsome compensation and ESOPs to grow your wealth along with the company for your trust in us at this stage.

### Location
Fully Remote with flexible work timings.

### Infrastructure

## Engineering Principles

### FAIL FAST, ITERATE FASTER
We want to build the right thing the right way. Fail fast means that you spend less time on things that don't work. Iterate faster to get feedback quickly because it’s costly to build the wrong thing

### AUTOMATE EVERYTHING
We want NO human intervention throughout our systems. Manual repetitive tasks are not scalable and are error-prone. Automation helps engineers do what they are good at - solve problems through code

### THINK PLATFORM, DO PLATFORM
We want engineers to have end-to-end responsibility for systems. Every system should be available as a service, which you build and run. Engineers being responsible for deploying and operating their own code brings accountability, responsibility and empowerment to influence production.

### SHARED CODE OWNERSHIP
We want everyone on the team to own code, design and architecture. It helps in sharing best practices and problem swarming. No silos means you and your teammates can enjoy vacations worry-free.

## Preferred Skill Set and Expertise
* You are a T-shaped Engineer who can work on a variety of problems by using the right tool for the right job.
* Familiar coding in any of the programming environments like Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C etc.
* Familiarity with any of the cross platform tools like React Native, Flutter etc.
* You’ve prior experience building a mobile app from scratch and publishing it on the Apple App Store / Google Play Store.
