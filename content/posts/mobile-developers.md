If you’re passionate about mobile platforms and translating code into user-friendly apps, we would like to meet you. As a Mobile developer, you’ll collaborate with internal teams to develop functional mobile applications, while working in a fast-paced environment.

Ultimately, you would be responsible for design and development of the next generation of Social Commerce Mobile App(s) across platforms.

This is a core member position who will have a lot of opportunities to grow and be part of decisions that influence the engineering culture within the organisation. We also provide handsome compensation and ESOPs to grow your wealth along with the company for your trust in us at this stage.

### Location
Fully Remote with flexible work timings.

## Ongoing Projects

### Social Commerce
Ability to set up a custom storefront against our catalog for our social influencers applying machine learning algorithms, heuristics and custom rules. Expose our catalog data as internal and external services for consumption with a high level of guarantee and availability.

### Search
Crunch data to present meaningful results to our users. Offer powerful and flexible query systems with strong guarantees on response times and availability.

### Mobile Apps
Crafting the most delightful experience for parents on mobile devices. Build a mobile experience that solves meaningful problems for millions of parents around the world through content and/or the most relevant products. 

### Infrastructure
Build and manage an infrastructure that displays, onboard and ships thousands of products on a day-to-day basis, keeping in mind the operational cost, ease-of-use, traceability and turnaround time.

## Engineering Principles

### FAIL FAST, ITERATE FASTER
We want to build the right thing the right way. Fail fast means that you spend less time on things that don't work. Iterate faster to get feedback quickly because it’s costly to build the wrong thing

### AUTOMATE EVERYTHING
We want NO human intervention throughout our systems. Manual repetitive tasks are not scalable and are error-prone. Automation helps engineers do what they are good at - solve problems through code

### THINK PLATFORM, DO PLATFORM
We want engineers to have end-to-end responsibility for systems. Every system should be available as a service, which you build and run. Engineers being responsible for deploying and operating their own code brings accountability, responsibility and empowerment to influence production.

### SHARED CODE OWNERSHIP
We want everyone on the team to own code, design and architecture. It helps in sharing best practices and problem swarming. No silos means you and your teammates can enjoy vacations worry-free.

## Preferred Skill Set and Expertise
* You are a T-shaped Engineer who can work on a variety of problems by using the right tool for the right job.
* Familiar coding in any of the programming environments like Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C etc.
* Familiarity with any of the cross platform tools like React Native, Flutter etc.
* You’ve prior experience building a mobile app from scratch and publishing it on the Apple App Store / Google Play Store.

Furthermore, to give you a glimpse into the kind of problems we solve at The Nestery we’ve placed a sample challenge below. Please take a look, and if you’re up for it, take a run at solving it. It’s a sure-fire way to impress us!

## Micro Store

### Your mission
Hey Mobile developer. Welcome. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to spend 2 hours creating an Mobile app demonstrating common tasks such as fetching data over network, parsing model entities from JSON, UI and navigation in any platform.

We would prefer you build the solution on Flutter/Dart stack, but feel free to use native Android or iOS stack or any other cross platform tools if that's what you're comfortable with.

### Your Tasks
- The main page of your app should show the contents of a 'shopping basket'. Inititially the basket will be empty, but it should be possible to add products to the basket and also to clear the current contents of the basket.
- Products to be added should be fetched from the API endpoint included below. They should be presented on a separate view controller, and the presentation should include at least the product name and image.
- When products have been added to the shopping basket, they should be visible on the main page along with a total, that is the sum of the retail prices of all the products added to the basket.
- Be creative with this. We want to see a functional app that demonstrates knowledge with the platform and the language. When in doubt, make an executive decision. Functionality is more important than the look and feel. If you finish early, feel free to polish it up.
- For instance: If the same product is added twice you are welcome to either show it twice in the basket - or show it once with a quantity of 2. That is up to you. You may choose to add functionality to display further details about a product - like the description, but only do this if you have the time.
- Once finished, send a link to your fork of the repository to [ashwanth@thenestery.in](mailto:ashwanth@thenestery.in)

### Grading
The exercise will be graded on a number of criteria including, but not limited to:

- Clean and readable code
- Code that to some extent follows the SOLID principles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- Demonstrated knowledge of MVC, delegation, UI and navigation, fetching and parsing JSON data, git, dependency management

### Micro API
There is only one API request:

```
https://run.mocky.io/v3/3ad24c64-49ea-4752-a04d-527b2e36ad28
```

The result is a JSON object of a GraphQL query from a [Shopify Store](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2022-01/queries/products)#products query.

#### NOTES:

- If the `variants.edges` have only 1 element, then the product has no variants, else they do.
- If you choose not to use any third party dependencies, but do everything on your own, don't worry about dependency management.
- You are free to choose the technology stack that you're comfortable with so that you can complete the task within a reasonable time limit.
