If you get an adrenaline rush when you hear about scale, if solving hard data problems is your thing or if squeezing the last bit out of your code to improve 1% query performance gives you a kick and you have some serious sense of humor, then The Nestery is the place for you!

This is a core member position who will have a lot of opportunities to grow and be part of decisions that influence the engineering culture within the organisation. We also provide handsome compensation and ESOPs to grow your wealth along with the company for your trust in us at this stage.

### Location
Fully Remote with flexible work timings.

## Ongoing Projects

### Social Commerce
Ability to set up a custom storefront against our catalog for our social influencers applying machine learning algorithms, heuristics and custom rules. Expose our catalog data as internal and external services for consumption with a high level of guarantee and availability.

### Search
Crunch data to present meaningful results to our users. Offer powerful and flexible query systems with strong guarantees on response times and availability.

### Mobile Apps
Crafting the most delightful experience for parents on mobile devices. Build a mobile experience that solves meaningful problems for millions of parents around the world through content and/or the most relevant products. 

### Infrastructure
Build and manage an infrastructure that displays, onboard and ships thousands of products on a day-to-day basis, keeping in mind the operational cost, ease-of-use, traceability and turnaround time.

## Engineering Principles

### FAIL FAST, ITERATE FASTER
We want to build the right thing the right way. Fail fast means that you spend less time on things that don't work. Iterate faster to get feedback quickly because it’s costly to build the wrong thing

### AUTOMATE EVERYTHING
We want NO human intervention throughout our systems. Manual repetitive tasks are not scalable and are error-prone. Automation helps engineers do what they are good at - solve problems through code

### THINK PLATFORM, DO PLATFORM
We want engineers to have end-to-end responsibility for systems. Every system should be available as a service, which you build and run. Engineers being responsible for deploying and operating their own code brings accountability, responsibility and empowerment to influence production.

### SHARED CODE OWNERSHIP
We want everyone on the team to own code, design and architecture. It helps in sharing best practices and problem swarming. No silos means you and your teammates can enjoy vacations worry-free.

## Preferred Skill Set and Expertise
* You are a T-shaped Engineer who can work on a variety of problems by using the right tool for the right job.
* Familiar coding in any of the programming environments like Java, Kotlin, Scala, Go etc.
* Familiarity with any event-driven, asynchronous I/O frameworks like NodeJS, Netty etc.
* Familiarity with any frontend frameworks like React, Angular etc.
* Familiarity with any of the relational database platforms like MySQL, Postgres, etc.
* Mobile Development experience with Android or iOS using Kotlin or Objective C or using cross platform toolchains like React Native or Flutter is a bonus.
* We value experience in search/information retrieval, extraction platforms like Apache Nutch, Lucene, Solr, Typesense and Tika.

Furthermore, to give you a glimpse into the kind of problems we solve at The Nestery we’ve placed a sample challenge below. Please take a look.  And if you’re up for it, take a run at solving it. It’s totally optional — but, it’s a sure-fire way to impress us!

## Code Search
Implement a fast (sub second query time) keyword search over the Redis source code. When a word or phrase is given, relevant code snippets and their corresponding source files should show up as results.

#### What we’re looking for
- We would like you to write your own algorithm, instead of using an off-the-shelf search solution like Lucene or Solr. Use of general purpose helper libraries (e.g. for basic data structures) is fine.
- Feel free to pick any language of your choice.

#### Bonus points
- Allow the user to specify whether the word is part of a function name, parameter list or variable name.
- A simple HTTP wrapper API to expose the search interface.

If you feel you have a good solution to this challenge, send us your solution (in a zip file) along with your resume and Github/LinkedIn profile to [ashwanth@thenestery.in](mailto:ashwanth@thenestery.in).
