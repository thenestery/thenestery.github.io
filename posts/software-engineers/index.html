Fail fast means that you spend less time on things that don’t work. Iterate faster to get feedback quickly because it’s costly to build the wrong thing\nAUTOMATE EVERYTHING We want NO human intervention throughout our systems. Manual repetitive tasks are not scalable and are error-prone. Automation helps engineers do what they are good at - solve problems through code\nTHINK PLATFORM, DO PLATFORM We want engineers to have end-to-end responsibility for systems. Every system should be available as a service, which you build and run. Engineers being responsible for deploying and operating their own code brings accountability, responsibility and empowerment to influence production.\nSHARED CODE OWNERSHIP We want everyone on the team to own code, design and architecture. It helps in sharing best practices and problem swarming. No silos means you and your teammates can enjoy vacations worry-free.\nPreferred Skill Set and Expertise  You are a T-shaped Engineer who can work on a variety of problems by using the right tool for the right job. Familiar coding in any of the programming environments like Java, Kotlin, Scala, Go etc. Familiarity with any event-driven, asynchronous I/O frameworks like NodeJS, Netty etc. Familiarity with any frontend frameworks like React, Angular etc. Familiarity with any of the relational database platforms like MySQL, Postgres, etc. Mobile Development experience with Android or iOS using Kotlin or Objective C or using cross platform toolchains like React Native or Flutter is a bonus. We value experience in search/information retrieval, extraction platforms like Apache Nutch, Lucene, Solr, Typesense and Tika.  If you are interested in exploring a life-changing opportunity with The Nestery, please send an email with your resume and Github/LinkedIn profile to ashwanth@thenestery.in.\n Furthermore, to give you a glimpse into the kind of problems we solve at The Nestery we’ve placed a sample challenge below. Please take a look. And if you’re up for it, take a run at solving it. It’s totally optional — but, it’s a sure-fire way to impress us!\nCode Search Implement a fast (sub second query time) keyword search over the Redis source code. When a word or phrase is given, relevant code snippets and their corresponding source files should show up as results.\nWhat we’re looking for  We would like you to write your own algorithm, instead of using an off-the-shelf search solution like Lucene or Solr. Use of general purpose helper libraries (e.g. for basic data structures) is fine. Feel free to pick any language of your choice.  Bonus points  Allow the user to specify whether the word is part of a function name, parameter list or variable name. A simple HTTP wrapper API to expose the search interface.
